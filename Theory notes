Theory						
	Class	Persistance class is created on top of table : creating field will create get and set method in same class 				
	Odata	RFC calls 	Pull operation			if $filter is given along with field name and value in Odata query then GetEntitySet is called
		API	Push operations			Other wise just give value like ('10001') after EntitySetName in query for GetEntity Method to be called 
		Cardinality is very important as to connect how many field to target if its 0..n then its get _entity and 1..n is get_entityset				
	Adobe	IN Adobe form for dynamic number of rows depending on table use floating field inside table->row->cell->floating field->bind normally				
	Table entry	To create entries in SE16N, you can either use the "Maintain Entries" checkbox if enabled for the table,				
		 or utilize debug mode by entering /h in the command field and setting the variables GD-EDIT and GD-SAPEDIT to "X".
